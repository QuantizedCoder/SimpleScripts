# SimpleScripts

A collection of lightweight, purpose-built scripts designed to streamline everyday development tasks, automate routine processes, and demonstrate key coding concepts. This repository serves as a modular toolbox for quick solutions, learning references, and customizable starter templates.

## Prerequisites

- NetSuite account with permission to create and deploy SuiteScript 2.1 scripts.
- Role access to create Script and Deployment records, Saved Searches, and File Cabinet folders.
- Optional: SFTP credential configuration if using the upload workflow.

## Included scripts

### `saved_search_export.js`
A Scheduled Script template for exporting employee data from a NetSuite saved search to a CSV file in the File Cabinet. Update:

- `SAVED_SEARCH_ID`: the internal ID of the saved search to export.
- `FILE_NAME` and `FOLDER_ID`: destination filename and target folder internal ID.
- `FIELD_LIST`: the columns you want in the CSV output.

The script builds CSV headers, iterates rows, cleans values to avoid malformed CSV content, and saves the file for downstream jobs.

### `suitelet_store_credentials.js`
A Suitelet that presents a form to generate and store an SFTP credential. Configure these constants before deployment:

- `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`: the allowed domain(s) for the credential.
- `ALLOWED_SCRIPT_IDS`: script IDs permitted to use the credential.

When submitted, the Suitelet returns the generated credential GUID to use in other scripts (e.g., the SFTP uploader).

### `scheduled_sftp_upload_credentials_needed.js`
A Scheduled Script that uploads a File Cabinet CSV to an SFTP server using a stored credential GUID and host key. Replace the placeholders for:

- `CREDENTIAL_GUID`: the GUID generated by `suitelet_store_credentials.js`.
- `HOST_KEY` and `SFTP_OPTIONS`: host key, host name, port, and directory path.
- `FILE_NAME`: the File Cabinet CSV you want to upload.

The script timestamps the uploaded filename, writes progress logs, and reports success or failure for monitoring.

## Suggested setup workflow

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Generate an SFTP credential** with `suitelet_store_credentials.js`, then copy the returned GUID and host key information.
3. **Export your data** with `saved_search_export.js`, confirming the saved search ID, folder destination, and CSV fields.
4. **Upload the exported CSV** with `scheduled_sftp_upload_credentials_needed.js` by setting the credential GUID, host key, and file name to the CSV created in step 3.
5. Deploy and test each script in a NetSuite sandbox before promoting to production.
